India Covid 19 vaccine slot booking helper
Currently We are booking our vaccine slots at https://selfregistration.cowin.gov.in/.
But most of the time we see all the slots booked completely.
https://under45.in/  has Telegram groups which notifies the subscribers immediately when Slots are available(if not Subscribed, please subsribe it first). Even with that live notifications,all the slots are getting booked within a minute and in the actual cowin site, we are unable to book slots, within that time. So this App mainly helps us to book slots, within seconds by Pre capturing all the necessary details we need to book.

2.Select the Dose( Default selection to 1)  
3.Slect the Age ( Default selection to 18 + option)  
4.Select State & Districts or  enter the pincode(comma separated, if multiple pin codes needed.) **mandatory**  

**Steps to book slot:**

2.Enter The mobile number and click the "Generate OTP" Button.
